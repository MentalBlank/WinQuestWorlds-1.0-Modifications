Set Up / Notes:
I Have also included a copy of F3ar's CMS Files so that you dont have to download more files....
1. Extract the Contents of 'AQWCMS Add-on - F3ar.zip' to your HTDOCS Folder
2. Extract the Contents of the 'Uploader' folder to your HTDOCS FOLDER... it will ask you if you want to overwrite some stuff, Click 'YES'
3. Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost/install.php and click install.
4. If you see 'You're news system has been installed!' delete the install.php file in your HTDOCS Folder
5. Navigate to http://localhost/ and have a look around
